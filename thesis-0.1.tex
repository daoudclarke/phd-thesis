\dropcap{I}\textsc{ndeed} all praise belongs to God. We ask for God's prayers and deep peace upon the final 
messenger Muhammad, the messenger of peace, love, mercy, justice and freedom, for it is only by his example that we may reach success, and without his guidance we would be lost. We ask that God may make this work a light and a mercy for mankind; that its benefits may shine out to all humanity and its defects may not cause harm; that He may encourage by it the seekers of His knowledge; and give success by it to those who fight for truth and justice.
 
 We begin in His name, and we pray for His help and guidance, for ``None shall encompass any of His knowledge except by His will''.  Finally, we ask the reader's forgiveness for any errors in what follows, for whatever is good is from Him, and whatever is bad is from ourselves.
